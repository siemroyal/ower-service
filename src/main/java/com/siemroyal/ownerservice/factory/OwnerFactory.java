     * POINTS:
     *
     * Factory Pattern
     *    This class is responsible for creating valid Owner aggregates.
     *    Creation rules should NOT live in controller or service layer.
     *
     * Explicit State Transition
     *    We are transforming a draft Owner into a PENDING Owner.
     *    Draft → PendingOwner
     *
     * Avoid Mutating Input Object
     *    Instead of modifying the draft object, we create a new instance.
     *    This prevents side effects and keeps logic predictable.
     *
     * Business Rule Enforcement
     *    All new Owners must start with status = PENDING.
     *    This is domain logic, not controller logic.
     *
     * Audit Fields Initialization
     *    On creation:
     *      createdAt = now
     *      updatedAt = now

     * ===============================
     * ENTERPRISE DESIGN PRINCIPLES
     * ===============================
     *
     *  Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
     *   - This class ONLY handles aggregate creation.
     *
     *  Clean Architecture
     *   - Controller handles HTTP
     *   - Service orchestrates flow
     *   - Factory handles creation logic
     *   - Repository handles persistence
     *
     *  Predictability
     *   - No mutation of existing objects.
     *
     *  Testability
     *   - Time source is injectable.
     *
     *  Lifecycle Integrity
     *   - Owner must start in PENDING state.
